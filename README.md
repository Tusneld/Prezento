## 🔖 Project Title & Description
**Prezento** – An AI-powered attendance tracking web application for schools, training programs, and small organizations.

  Prezento allows teachers, admins, and managers to track attendance digitally. Students/employees can check in, reports are automatically generated, and attendance trends are visualized.  

- **Who it’s for**:  
  Schools, training centers, and organizations that want to replace error-prone manual attendance tracking with automation.  

- **Why it matters**:  
  Manual attendance is inefficient and lacks data insights. Prezento introduces automation, real-time reporting, and AI-powered predictions (e.g., absenteeism trends).
